# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Style-Transfer

Here, Iam implementing Style Transfer Using Keras and Tensorflow Backend. The purpose of this project is to get an intuition of the 
2015 "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) using a pre-trained VGGnet as the model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556).
